Gift One: Interactive Story
The first gift we design and develop together will be one that tells a story. At first blush, the word story might pigeonhole itself as fiction or folklore, but the power of narrative to inspire and entertain has as many ancient forms as it does modern. Services like Twitter, Facebook, and Snapchat collect our words, images, videos, and other artifacts of our digital interactions to construct “stories” aiming to tell the narratives of our lives and relationships. In the world of journalism and civic media, amplifying the “stories” of individuals and communities over those of money and politics is the basis of much talk and dreaming. Big data and data visualization even promise to tell system-level narratives, helping us to tell the “stories” we can only see by zooming out and observing large-scale trends and patterns.

Whether you receive these new forms of story-telling with skepticism, excitement, or something in between, we want to use this first project as an opportunity to explore the many different forms a story can take and the new storytelling experiences now possible natively within the browser and with physical extensions supported by modern browsers. We hope you will follow your own interests and aesthetic sensibilities as you develop a story-based project of your own design.

To serve as inspiration, we’d like to offer a few examples of story-based projects we love including Snowfall, a 2012 New York Times news story put together with interactive media elements embedded throughout, this 2013 annual report by Mail Chimp telling the story of their company's year by bringing numbers to life, The Beast, a poem by Laura Marling with accompanying illustration and audio animated in the browser for an interactice, storytelling experience, and The Coming Out Simulator an interactive, choose-your-own-adventure style story told via text message exploring the challenges of coming out.

To get you started on the actual coding, we will also provide you with a project we've built by scratch, telling the story of a relationship through poems, texts, pictures, audio recordings, and videos collected over weeks and months, put together in a scrapbook form that can be viewed based on geography, time and date, or other user-generated tags through a screen and physical interface.  You will have access to all the code and physical elements to recreate and extend this project into one that is meaningful to you and someone you care about.
